## Membership Perks

For all members, your participation as a 3DC member will be in your official fifth-row transcript. As a Google-affiliated Developer Student Club (DSC), I think that alone should carry some weight in your portfolio

Projects completed with 3DC can be publicized on our platforms. This can extend to finding team mates (in SUTD as well as potentially from other unis) as well as just overall publicity of completed projects. Your projects completed with 3DC will also be reflected in your school transcript as well. Core Team Members can also provide mentorship for the project. In addition, the club is able to provide the team with GCP credits from Google.

For members keen to host workshops, we can provide publicity and can help to find fellow Instructors (assistants) to help streamline your workshop. If it is online, we can also allow it to be hosted on our Twitch account and posted on our YouTube channel.

For Hackathons, we can help you to recruit team mates that have different strengths and skillsets. We can also allow you to work with other students you may usually not work with.

## 3 Pathways to Gain Membership
- [Project](#pathway-1-do-a-project-with-3dc)
- [Workshop](#pathway-2-organise-a-workshop-with-3dc)
- [Hackthon](#pathway-3-join-a-hackthon-with-3dc)

## Pathway 1: Do a Project with 3DC

These projects can be from:
- Member-Initiated
- Core-Team suggestions
- (If any) school-proposed
- (If possible) start-up sourced

If the project last for more than 1 term, members will be awarded membership for the duration of the project. If the project is dropped, the term in which the project and after, the members will not count as having this condition fulfilled. (aka if ghost, no count).

## Pathway 2: Organise a Workshop with 3DC

If you have passion about certain technical topic that you wanna share it with your peers, or if you are passionate about teaching and helping others. You can cooperate with 3DC and organise a workshop/ lecture/ sharing session.

### Example of possible topics:

> Note: Topic of workshop/ lecture/ sharing session is not limited at all, you can pick any topic of your like, present it at any level of difficulty of your like. We only wish that you are passionate about what you are sharing, and we wish the topic to be as diverse as possible.

For workshops, it should engage participants with hands-on activities, the pace of the workshop should be as slow as possible. Lecturing time versus hands-on activity time should be around 50:50. Some example topics for workshops may looks like:

- How to build your first website
- How to build native iOS App with SwiftUI
- How to build a Todo App using ReactJS

For lectures, you can have less interactions with audience, you don't need to design any hands-on activities. Some topics suit for lecture may looks like:

- What is vim and why you should give it a try
- What are the best practices in using Vue.JS
- What is parallelism in Python and how do you use it.

For sharing sessions, you can share about your internship experience, UROP experience, job-finding experience. It should come with a longer Q&A time. Some example topics for inspiration:

- Start-up or Big Corp, which one should you choose?
- How to prepare for technical interview
- Undergraduate research 101 - UROP experience sharing

### Perks:

3DC can help you with:

- Event application & administrative matters
- Event publicity & announcement
- Workshop content refinement, quality control
- Video recording / steaming
- TA supports

You can gain:

- Workshop directing experience
- Official fifth-row record
- 3DC membership for a year
