# Recess Week Challenge: Cloud-Based Lab

## Introduction

Welcome to 3DC's cloud-based lab! This lab has the following aims:

1. Create a web-app with a working backend API 
2. The web-app can serve a very simple webpage as well that makes use of the backend API
3. Deploy the web-app onto the cloud.

For this lab tutorial, we will be using Flask(a Python backend framework). There will be tutorials to deploy the web-app onto all 3 major cloud service providers (Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud Platform).

We strongly encourage you to explore other options for creating a web-app (e.g. Express/Spring/ASP.NET/Django), as well as the other services provided by cloud providers, to learn more!
