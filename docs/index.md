Digital Design & Development Club (3DC) is a Google Developer Student Club (DSC) at ISTD Pillar of [Singapore University of Technology & Design (SUTD)](https://www.sutd.edu.sg/).

We are a community group seeking to empower students in their journey in school. By joining our DSC, students will be able to build up their professional and personal skills, get access to Google developer resources, and work together to build solutions for local problems in a peer-to-peer learning environment.

## OpenNodes Collaboration

OpenNodes is an initiative started by Tribe and IMDA Singapore, and is supported by more than 30 leading global corporates and government agencies with 3DC running SUTDâ€™s branch of Opennodes. The aim is to foster greater collaboration between various stakeholders within the tech ecosystem.

OpenNodes Campus Collective is an extension of these efforts, and will be the first time students from various universities across Singapore will be brought together for career opportunities and education resources. Opennodes connects students with projects from companies like IBM and WeBank to give students industry exposure. It will also be pushing out educational workshops for students to learn technical and consulting skills.
