Digital Design & Development Club (3DC) is a Google Developer Student Club (DSC) at ISTD Pillar of [Singapore University of Technology & Design (SUTD)](https://www.sutd.edu.sg/).

We are a community group seeking to empower students in their journey in school. By joining our DSC, students will be able to build up their professional and personal skills, get access to Google developer resources, and work together to build solutions for local problems in a peer-to-peer learning environment.
