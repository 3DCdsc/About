Pathway 2: Organise a Workshop with 3DC # If you have passion about certain technical topic that you wanna share it with your peers, or if you are passionate about teaching and helping others.

We only wish that you are passionate about what you are sharing, and we wish the topic to be as diverse as possible. For workshops, it should engage participants with hands-on activities, the pace of the workshop should be as slow as possible. Lecturing time versus hands-on activity time should be around 50:50.

Some topics suit for lecture may looks like: What is vim and why you should give it a try What are the best practices in using Vue.JS What is parallelism in Python and how do you use it. For sharing sessions, you can share about your internship experience, UROP experience, job-finding experience. It should come with a longer Q&A time.
